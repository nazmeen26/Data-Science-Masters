    "Q1. `Role of Optimization Algorithms in Artificial Neural Networks:`\n",
    "Optimization algorithms play a crucial role in training artificial neural networks. They are responsible for updating the model parameters (weights and biases) during the training process, with the objective of minimizing the loss function. The goal is to find the optimal set of parameters that results in the best performance of the neural network on the given task, such as classification or regression. Optimization algorithms are necessary because training a neural network involves finding the best parameter values in a high-dimensional space, which is a challenging optimization problem."

    "Traditional gradient descent methods, especially batch gradient descent, suffer from several challenges:\n",

    "Modern optimizers, such as Adam (Adaptive Moment Estimation), RMSprop (Root Mean Square Propagation), and Adagrad (Adaptive Gradient Algorithm), address these challenges by adapting the learning rate for each parameter individually, introducing momentum, and maintaining adaptive estimates of the second moments of the gradients. These adaptive methods help improve convergence speed and overcome issues related to slow convergence and local minima."

It introduces a momentum term that accumulates a running average of past gradients and influences the direction of parameter updates. This helps the optimization process to overcome oscillations and escape shallow local minima.\n",

A high learning rate may lead to overshooting the optimal solution, causing instability, while a low learning rate may result in slow convergence. Modern optimizers, like Adam, adaptively adjust the learning rate based on past gradients to strike a balance between stability and convergence speed."
