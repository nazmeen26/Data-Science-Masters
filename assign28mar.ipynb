    "- Linearity: Ridge regression assumes that the relationship between the independent and dependent variables is linear. It means that the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable is constant and additive.\n",
    "- Independence: It considers that the observations in the dataset are independent of each other.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: This regression assumes that the error terms (residuals) variance is constant across all levels of the independent variables. This is known as homoscedasticity.\n",
    "- No Multicollinearity: Ridge regression assumes no perfect multicollinearity among the independent variables. \n",
    "- Normally Distributed Errors: It assumes that the errors (residuals) follow a normal distribution with a zero mean. This assumption ensures the validity of statistical inference and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "- No Endogeneity: Ridge regression believes there is no endogeneity, which occurs when there is a correlation between the independent variables and the error term. "

Cross-validation involves dividing the data into multiple subsets, training the model on different combinations of these subsets, and evaluating the performance using a chosen metric (e.g., mean squared error). The lambda value that results in the best performance is then selected. Grid search involves evaluating the model's performance for different lambda values specified in a grid and selecting the one with the optimal performance.\n",

    "## A7. The interpretation of coefficients in Ridge Regression is similar to that in ordinary least squares regression. The coefficients represent the relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable, considering the other variables in the model. However, due to the regularization effect of Ridge Regression, the coefficients are penalized and may be smaller in magnitude compared to OLS regression. Higher lambda values lead to further shrinkage of the coefficients. Thus, the magnitude of the coefficients should be interpreted with caution. The sign of the coefficients indicates the direction of the relationship (positive or negative), while the magnitude reflects the strength of the association after considering the penalty term.\n"
