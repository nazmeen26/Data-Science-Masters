    "##  Min-Max scaling is a data preprocessing technique used to scale numerical data to a specific range, usually between 0 and 1. It works by subtracting the minimum value of the data and then dividing by the range of the data. This technique is useful for data normalization and can help improve the performance of machine learning algorithms.\n",

So a score of 70 would be scaled to (70-60)/40 = 0.25."
