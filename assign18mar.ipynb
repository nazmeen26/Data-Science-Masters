This paper proposes a new filter feature selection approach for customer churn prediction in telecommunications. The main idea of this approach is to calculate the dependency between each input feature and the class. Finally, the comparative experiments were carried out, and the results show that the new proposed feature selection approach is very effective for the churn prediction.\n"
