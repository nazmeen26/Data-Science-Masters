    "## Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression model that combines the penalties of both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization techniques. It is used to handle the limitations of these individual regularization techniques. Elastic Net adds two terms to the linear regression cost function: one that penalizes the absolute value of the coefficients (L1 penalty) and another that penalizes the squared value of the coefficients (L2 penalty). This allows Elastic Net to perform both variable selection and handle correlated predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The main difference between Elastic Net Regression and other regression techniques, such as Lasso and Ridge Regression, is that Elastic Net addresses the limitations of each. Lasso tends to select only one variable among highly correlated predictors, while Ridge Regression doesn't perform variable selection. Elastic Net combines the strengths of both methods, allowing for variable selection and handling multicollinearity.\n",
